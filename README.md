emotes
------

Quality of life improvements for emotes.

Currently allows you to:
* use special emotes in any outfit as long as you have an eligible
  costume in your inventory
* reuse looping emotes when interrupted

For the latter, use the following command:

* `/w /force sit`
* `/w /force settle` (must have emote and school uniform)
* `/w /force dance`
* `/w /force kitchen` (must have emote and maid uniform)

**This is experimental**, which is just code for "this is some really
messed up code". Things might break. Be careful doing special emotes
with unbound outfits in your inventory because I have no idea what
will happen with those.

If it does glitch for whatever reason, just equip and unequip the
outfits you needed to be wearing for the emote you were using.
