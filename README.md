emotes
------

Quality of life improvements for emotes.

Currently allows you to use special emotes in any outfit as long as
you have an eligible costume in your inventory.

**This is experimental**, which is just code for "this is some really
messed up code". Things might break. Be careful with unbound outfits,
because I have no idea what will happen with those.

If it does glitch for whatever reason, just equip and unequip the
outfits you needed to be wearing for the emote you were using.

The next planned feature is watching for when continuous emotes (sit,
settle, dance, and kitchen dance) are interrupted by others and then
instantly reusing the emote without needing a macro.
